## Description
All a good teacher wants, is to teach. To give over inspiring lessons, interesting classes. But those materials, don't just come from nowhere! they take hours of research and hard work to reach a complete lesson. just ONE lesson. by the end of the day, there is no more energy left to actually.... teach.
This is where we come in. Teachers Teach is a platform that will allow teachers to do what they really love, by sharing recourses, that will improve and enrich their lessons with a click.
Because all we have is each other.
